1. We created a class “BaseClass” which contains public data member “var_base” and member function “display”. The member function “display” will print the value of data member “var_base”
2. We created another class “DerivedClass” which is inheriting “BaseClass” and contains data member “var_derived” and member function “display”. The member function “display” will print the values of data members “var_base” and “var_derived”
The code for the main program is shown below,

1. We created a pointer “base_class_pointer” of the data type “Baseclass”.
2. Object “obj_base” of the data type “BaseClass” is created.
3. Object “obj_derived” of the data type “DerivedClass” is created
4. Pointer “base_class_pointer” of the base class is pointing to the object “obj_derived” of the derived class
5. By using the pointer “base_class_pointer” of the base class we have set the value of the data member “var_base” by “34”. The main thing to note here is that we cannot set the value of the derived class data member by using the base class pointer otherwise the compiler will throw an error.
6. The function “display” is called using a base class pointer. The main thing to note here is that the base class “display” function will run here.
7. Again by using the pointer “base_class_pointer” of the base class we have set the value of the data member “var_base” by “3400” which will update the previous value and the function “display” is called.
8. We created a pointer “derived_class_pointer” of the data type “DerivedClass”
9. Pointer “Derived_class_pointer” of the derived class is pointing to the object “obj_derived” of the derived class
10. By using pointer “Derived_class_pointer” of the derived class we have set the value of the data member “var_base” of the base class by “9448”. The main thing to note here is that this will not throw an error because we can set the value of base class data member by using derived class pointer but we cannot set the value of derived class data member by using base class pointer
11. By using pointer “Derived_class_pointer” of the derived class we have set the value of the data member “var_derived” of the derived class by “98”.
12. The function “display” is called using a derived class pointer. The main thing to note here is that the derived class “display” function will run here.
